## Training Algorithm

### This repository is meant for solving algorithm problems and practicing algorithm theory.

Anyone can contribute this repository if you follow below the guidelines.

1. Filename<br>
   : You should create a name for the file as below.<br>
   "site name" + "problem number" + "\_" + "your nickname".cpp

   - Examples<br>
     : CF1426C_khusw.cpp, BOJ1004_khusw.cpp

   "site name" means a coding problem-solving site such as codeforce, baekjoon online judge

   when determining "site name", it should be abbreviated.<br>
   (codeforce -> CF, baekjoon online judge -> BOJ)<br>

   <b> This repository only use two sites, "codeforces", "baekjoon online judge"</b>

   If you have simply created the basic code for the algorithm, rather than solving the algorithm problem, you should name the file AlgorithmName_nickname.cpp

   - Examples<br>
     : DFS_khusw.cpp, DP_khusw.cpp, KMP_khusw.cpp

2. Folder name<br>
   : Folder name should be specified as "the language name used" + "/" + "the algorithm name used"

   - Examples<br>
     : cpp/DP, cpp/DFS, cpp/Dijkstra

3. Review <br>
   : Everyone can review each other's codes. If you find someone's code is logically wrong, create an issue.

4. Others<br>
   - Problem Solving<br>
     : If your code cannot get a 100% score on the algorithm site, the pull request will be refused.
     <br>
     If there is a more efficient code, please put the code on the issue.
   - Algorithm code<br>
     : If there is a more efficient code, please put the code on the issue.
   - Language<br>
     : This Repository only use <b>c++.
   - Comments<br>
     : Don't write unncessary comments in your code.
