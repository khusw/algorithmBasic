## Training Algorithm

### This repository is for problem-solving and practicing algorithm theory.

- - - 

Anyone can contribute this repository if you follow below the guidelines.


1. Filename<br>
   : You should create a name for the file as below.<br>
   "problem number" + "\_" + "your nickname".cpp<br>

   - Examples<br>
     : Staircase_khusw.cpp, SimpleArraySum_khusw.cpp
    
   <b>This Project only use hackerrank site.</b>

   If you have simply created the basic code for the algorithm, rather than solving the algorithm problem, you should name the file AlgorithmName_nickname.cpp

   - Examples<br>
     : DFS_khusw.cpp, DP_khusw.cpp, KMP_khusw.cpp

2. Folder name<br>
   : Folder name should be specified as "the language name used" + "/" + "the algorithm name used"

   - Examples<br>
     : cpp/DP, cpp/DFS, cpp/Dijkstra

3. Review <br>
   : Everyone can review each other's codes. If you find someone's code is logically wrong, create an issue.

4. Others<br>
   - Problem Solving<br>
     : If your code cannot get a 100% score on the algorithm site, the pull request will be refused.
     <br>
     If there is a more efficient code, please put the code on the issue.
   - Algorithm code<br>
     : If there is a more efficient code, please put the code on the issue.
   - Language<br>
     : This Repository only use <b>c++.</b>
